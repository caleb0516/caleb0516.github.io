        Unfortunately, in this slide, there will be no interactive d3 graphs as the data needed is not public. But an explanation can still be derived
        from the two images above. The first image is a graph created by Joseph Politano, and the second image is another graph from pragmaticeengineer.com.
        The first image shows us that despite, having a lot of deposits, SVB had nearly no insured deposits. This means that if people were to come to withdraw
        at rapid rates, the bank will not be able to keep up and eventually fail, and this is exactly what happened. The second image shows us that the bank had near 200 billion
        dollars in deposits, but within a short period, it went to 0. Although not shown in these images the exact amount is $142 billion withdrawn over 2 days.
        Though the market was recovering, the bank was not able to keep up with the withdrawals and eventually failed. It is believed that social media sped up this process as rumor spread of
        SVB failing. So in conclusion though market prices impact banks immensely, it is not the sole reason for failure. WMB may have failed due to market states, but SVB eventually failed due to
        mass withdrawals.
